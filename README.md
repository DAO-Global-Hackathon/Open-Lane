# Open-Lane
The Open Lane phase of the DAO Global Hackathon 2021 is finally open until December 12th.

## Aragon Bounties Are Focused On

This is an event focused on DAO tooling. It's also a highly collaborative event, and you'll see that we've co-sponsored several bounties with other teams.

We have envisioned the following 4 tracks as crucial areas of development for DAO tooling and infrastructure. Each track will be supported and sponsored by a number of Hackathon partners.

## Tracks
### Multi-chain
Empower DAOs to embrace a multi-chain world with cross-chain DAO tooling and scaling solutions.

### Core DAO Tech
Enable core DAO functionalities such as a decentralized code base, smart contract treasuries, voting tech (e.g. delegated anonymous, quadratic voting, etc).

### Finance & Operations
Formalize DAO operations (KPI options, on-off ramps, streaming payments, salaries & invoicing, etc), legal wrappers & compliance, payments tech.

### Community & NFTs
Empower cross-platform, cohesive, token-based social platforms, token-gated content and communities, NFT-based proposal formations and notification systems.
